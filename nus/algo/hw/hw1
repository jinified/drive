R1.
a)O(n^2)
b)O(n log n)
c)O(n^2)

R2
a)property of log. summation of log k = N ln N ~ theta(N log N) 
a) arithmethic mean summation n(n+1)/2 ~ theta(N^2)

S1
a) divide & conquer. guessing upper+lower/2. 2^9 = 512. Ken and Steven 9 each in the worst case. 
b) 
    i) why does it terminates ? after each round of pairing the number of students is halved. r < 1 therefore converges. 
       what is the number in step5 ? 
       number of additions ? log(2)n
    ii)number of step 2 needed ? should be same as number of additions performed 
    iii) what if not synchronized ? 


S2
a) Since the boys will have the best valid partner b-C is the only stable pairing 
b)

a -> A B C D    A -> a b c d 
b -> B A C D    B -> b a c d 

c) best possible rounds bound given by R(n) <= n^2-2n+2

a | A C B   A | c b a 
b | A C B   B | c b a 
c | C A B   C | a c b

S3

a)i) empty, A2, empty ii) A2, A3, A8, A9 4 rooms required 
b) bbst to store events and priority queue
